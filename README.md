React Portfolio Site with Theme Switching
Build a responsive portfolio website using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS that supports dynamic theme switching (light and dark modes) and user preferences (e.g., font size, reduced motion). This project will utilize useReducer and Context for state management.

Building Your Portfolio Site
Hero Section: Introduce yourself with a compelling headline and a brief bio.
Projects Section: Display your projects using cards or a grid layout. Each project should have a title, description, used tech and possibly a link to the live site or code repository.
Contact Section: Provide your professional contact information.
Setup Project
npx create-next-app portfolio
Edit tailwind.config.js to enable dark mode:

module.exports = {
darkMode: "class",
// other configurations...
};
ThemeContext and ThemeProvider
Create ThemeContext.js to manage theme and user preferences:

import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext();

const initialState = {
theme: "light",
userPreferences: {
fontSize: "medium",
reduceAnimations: false,
},
};

function themeReducer(state, action) {
// your code here
}

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
// your code here
};

// Create and use your own hook instead of using useContext in the components
export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
Applying the Theme Dynamically
In tailwind dark or light mode is set by adding or removing a class called dark in the root html tag. Use ThemeContext in \_app.js to apply the theme class to the root element:

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "../contexts/ThemeContext";
import "../styles/globals.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
const { state } = useTheme();

useEffect(() => {
// Your code here. Add the dark class to the <html /> tag
// with vanilla js.
}, [state.theme]);

return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
<ThemeProvider>
<MyApp Component={Component} pageProps={pageProps} />
</ThemeProvider>
);
Creating the ThemeSwitcher and Handling User Preferences
Implement a component to toggle the theme and adjust user preferences:

Using User Preferences in Components
Demonstrate using userPreferences in a component, adjusting styles based on the context state:
